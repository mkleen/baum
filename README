This is a simple implementation of the decision tree algorithm from Ross Quinlan for Scala 

The reason behind this little project is that all other implementations and libraries of the id3/c 4.5 algorithms i have worked with, have the limitation that it is not possible to access to the generated tree structure itself and they dont  work with a real object oriented domain model. So far this little prototype solves at least these 2 problems.

If you want to build the project, make sure sbt is installed, then execute the commands:  
git clone git://github.com/mkleen/baum.git
cd baum
sbt update
sbt compile
 
Have a look at baum.WeatherExample1.scala in /test/scala which models a classical example from the book "Datamining - Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques" from  I. Witten and Eibe Frank. You can run the the example with the sbt command "sbt test-only baum.WeatherExample1"

There are a couple of features missing, most of the are part of the c 4.5 version of the algorithm: 
- integrate confidence score 
- support for numerical values
- support for missing values
