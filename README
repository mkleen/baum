This is a simple implementation of the decision tree algorithm from Ross Quinlan for Scala 

The reason for this little project is that all other implementations and libraries of the id3/c 4.5 algorithms I have worked with, have the limitation that it is not possible to access the generated tree structure. Also none of them are able to operate on domain model instead of tabular data. So far this little prototype solves at least these 2 problems.

If you want to build the project, make sure sbt is installed, then execute the commands:  
git clone git://github.com/mkleen/baum.git
cd baum
sbt update
sbt compile
 
Have a look at baum.WeatherExample1.scala in /test/scala which models a classical example from the book "Datamining - Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques" from  I. Witten and Eibe Frank. You can run the the example with the sbt following sbt command:
sbt test-only baum.WeatherExample1

There are a couple of features missing, most of the are part of the c 4.5 version of the algorithm: 
- integrate confidence score 
- support for numerical values
- support for missing values
